    "In lecture, we looked at a probabilistic model of a DGP in which documents are assigned to clusters; clusters differ in their word usage; and documents' token counts are drawn from a multinomial distribution. Let's create a simulated data set of a DFM that would be generated by such a model. We will use tools available in `numpy` to do the sampling and the matrix algebra. We'll also set the seed by creating a random number generator called `rng` with a seed of `2026`. Warning: if you run the following cells out of order (or re-run them more than once), you will no longer get the same numbers. Keep this in mind when you compare your results with what is written in the text."
