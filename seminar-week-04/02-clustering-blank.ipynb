The default is to apply the L2 norm, which is another way of saying the vector for each row is normalised by its vector magnitude. This is exactly what we did when we computed cosine similarity in week 3 lecture. This normalisation removes differences due purely to document length, allowing clustering to focus on differences in word composition rather than scale."
