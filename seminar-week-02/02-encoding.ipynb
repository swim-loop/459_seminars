    "\n",
    "### A brief primer on directories\n",
    "\n",
    "A [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) is a location on your computer that can contain computer files (or other directories). These are commonly referred to as \"folders\" and we will use both terms in this course. On all modern operating systems, directories are arranged in a nested structure. Every directory on a computer can be located using a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)), which is the \"address\" of the directory. Paths look different on Windows and MacOS computers, and you should familiarise yourself with your system's path formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every user account on a modern operating system has a home folder that is the user's top level directory (or their \"root\" directory). For example, on Ryan's computer, the home directory is `/Users/r.hubert/`. This path indicates that Ryan's home directory (or \"folder\") is called \"r.hubert\" and it is located inside of a higher level directory (or a \"parent directory\") called \"Users\". All MacOS computers should use a similar structure for the home folder. In most situations, it does not matter whether you write the path to a directory with a slash at the end or not: `/Users/r.hubert/` and `/Users/r.hubert` are both valid paths for the `r.hubert` directory. In Unix-like operating systems like MacOS and Linux, it is customary to use a tilde to stand for the home folder. So, on Ryan's computer, the path `~` is equivalent to the path `/Users/r.hubert`. On Windows machines, the tilde notation sometimes works but not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paths can be used to indicate the locations of directories on a computer, as well as the locations of files on a computer. Typically, files on modern operating systems have file extensions, such as `.docx` for Word documents and `.txt` for plain text documents. Directories do not have such extensions. So, while `/Users/r.hubert/Documents` is a path for the Documents folder, `/Users/r.hubert/Documents/my_file.txt` is a path to a specific file stored inside the Documents folder. On Unix-like machines (and in some contexts on Windows machines) these two paths can also be written `~/Documents` and `~/Documents/my_file.txt`, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the paths written here have been _absolute_ paths, meaning that they specify full (or \"absolute\") locations. In some contexts you can use _relative_ paths, which are shortened paths that give the location of a directory or file relative to a current [working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory). We will almost always use absolute paths in this course because they leave no room for ambiguity. However, you might find it useful to familiarise yourself with the difference by reading the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing directories in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we need to use Python to read digital data from our computer's storage device(s) or write digital data to our computer's storage device(s), we need to be very careful to specify precisely _where_ we want to read or write data. So, many of the Python notebooks in this course will begin with some _directory management_ where we (1) specify various paths to important locations on our computer where relevant digital data will be read and/or written, and (2) download or copy any necessary files to these locations. In Python, the `os` module has many tools for interacting with an operating system's directory and file system, as you will see below."
