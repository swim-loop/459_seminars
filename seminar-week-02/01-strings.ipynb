At a minimum, you should read [Python's official HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html), and look over the [`re` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-contents). You should also practice using regex to do various string manipulations. You can also test out regex patterns at <https://regex101.com/> (switch to Python!), or get an LLM to help you. (You will need to know some regex for the exam.)"
