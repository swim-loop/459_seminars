Why? We might care about word ordering in our analysis and n-grams give us a crude way to include word order information in our document features. First, let's see how we can extract all the ngrams of a certain size from a single list of tokens representing one document.

The core problem is that DFMs are usually sparse matrices (or arrays) \"where only a few locations in the array have any data, most of the locations are considered as “empty”\" ([Source](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/sparse.html)). As you just saw, even this relatively small corpus created sparse DFMs that were very large (in memory and in storage).\n",
